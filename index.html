    <li>I will be attending the annual meeting of the APS Division of Plasma Physics in Portland, OR and presenting my research at a <a href="http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DPP18/Session/TP11.127">poster session.</a></li>
    <li>A journal article I authored near the end of my PhD has been accepted for publication in the Special Edition for Radio Wave Propagation of the IEEE Transaction on Antennas & Propagation. The paper can be found in the <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8485766&isnumber=4907023">Early Access</a> issue of the journal.</li> 
    <li>I presented my research on optimization of XGC on Intel KNL architecture at the <a href="https://www.ixpug.org/events/ixpug-fallconf-2018">IXPUG Annual Fall Meeting.</a> A video recording can be found <a href="http://intelstudios.edgesuite.net/180925_IXPUG/archive/180926_IXPUG_Day2-Lightning_Talk_Mackie-Mason.html">here</a> and my slides can be found <a href="https://www.ixpug.org/components/com_solutionlibrary/assets/documents/1538423421-IXPUG_Fall_Conf_2018_paper_26%20-%20Rev3%20-%20Brian%20Mackie-Mason%20(002).pdf">here.</a></li>
    <li>I will be starting a postdoctoral research associate position at the <a href="http://www.anl.gov">Argonne National Laboratory</a> on March 19, 2018. I will be studying the high-fidelity simulation of fusion reactor boundary plasmas within the <a href="http://www.alcf.anl.gov">Leadership Computing Facility</a>. This position is part of a larger effort to eventually bring nuclear fusion to the commerical power industry. Here is a link to the Wikipedia page on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion">Nuclear Fusion.</a>
    <li>I have successfully defended my dissertation. You can find an abstract of my talk <a href="professionalDocuments/Brian%20MacKie-Mason.pdf">here.</a>
    <!--<li>I presented my paper entitled "Towards Real-time In-Situ Antenna Analysis and Design on Platforms of 1000 Wavelengths" at the <a href="http://2017apsursi.org">2017 IEEE AP-S Conference.</a>
    <li>As a nice break from my grueling few weeks, I was recently honored at a university-wide ceremony called "Who's Who Among American Universities and Colleges" Feb. 18, 2017 at the UNM Student Union Building.
    <li>Well, the time has come. The next major project I will undertake is to prepare my <a href="http://grad.unm.edu/resources/start-to-finish-unm/phd/comprehensive-exam.html">dissertation proposal</a>. This includes forming a committee, preparing a presentation, and writing a medium-length paper (depending on the needs of my committee). Proposal to take place on Mar. 8, 2017 at 11:00am.
    <li>After returning from the National Radio Science Meeting (see below) I spent January 9-16, 2017 preparing a two-page summary for submission to the annual <a href = "http://2017apsursi.org">IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society Meeting</a>.
    <li>I attended the <a href="https://nrsmboulder.org">National Radio Science Meeting</a> from January 3-6, 2017 in Boulder, CO. I presented my research on the real-time optimization of extreme-scale electromagnetic problems January 6 at 4:40pm. You can find the schedule <a href="https://nrsmboulder.org/sites/default/files/NRSM%202017%20Program%20Sessions%20Final.pdf">here.</a> The information for my presentation is on page 66.</li>
    <li>I attended <a href="http://sc16.supercomputing.org">The International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis</a> from November 13-16 and presented <a href="http://sc16.supercomputing.org/presentation/?id=post273&sess=sess318">"Extreme Fidelity Computational Electromagnetic Analysis in the Supercomputer Era"</a> on Tuesday, November 15th from 5:30-7pm in the Lower Lobby Concourcse, Exhibit Hall E - Poster Board 106. I solicited many fruitful discussions and got some great recommendations and suggestions on my research. You can find a full report below.</li>-->
