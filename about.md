I originally began my academic career in nuclear engineering with an interest of being part of the clean energy solution. However, since that time I have found my passion in developing more fundamental computational science problems. My current position is as a Doctoral Candidate and Research Assistant in computational electromagnetics in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](http://www.ece.unm.edu) at the [University of New Mexico](http://www.unm.edu). I am currently developing and implementing algorithms to tackle extreme-scale electromagnetic engineering problems.

In addition to my professional interests I have found a passion in serving the student population through my participation in [student government](http://www.gpsa.unm.edu). Other personal interests of mine include exercising (in particular weightlifting), skiing, and watching sports. You will not find a bigger University of Michigan football fan than me. Go blue!
