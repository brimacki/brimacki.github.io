I am currently a postdoctoral appointee at the [Argonne Leadership Computing Facility](https://www.alcf.anl.gov) working as a High-Performance Computing expert supporting a [project](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/projects/high-fidelity-simulation-fusion-reactor-boundary-plasmas) that studies the high-fidelity simulation of edge plasma physics in a [Tokamak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokamak) fusion reactor. I originally began my fascination with nuclear energy about fifteen years ago in high school chemistry. My previous position was as a Graduate Student Research Assistant studying computational electromagnetics in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](http://www.ece.unm.edu) at the [University of New Mexico](http:/www.unm.edu). During my graduate studies, I published two journal articles (with more to come based on that research), participated in about a half-dozen inter/national conferences, and numerous other professional gatherings. My research was supervised by [Zhen Peng](https://sites.google.com/site/zhenpeng11111/home), and was focused on the development and implementation of novel algorithms to tackle extreme-scale electromagnetic engineering problems. My doctoral research was primarily supported by the DoD HPCMP PETTT Program.

In addition to my professional interests I have found a passion in serving the student population through my participation in [student government](http://gpsa.unm.edu). Other personal interests of mine include exercising, skiing, and watching sports. You will not find a bigger University of Michigan football fan than me. Go blue!

My name has its own unique story. My first name often gets confused with "Brain", which I believe to be a result of Microsoft's AutoCorrect. I usually don't correct folks on that typo. My middle name is my maternal grandfather's first name. My last name is the combination of my father and mother's maiden names. "Mason" does not have a long in-depth history that I'm aware of. The name "MacKie" has an interesting story. It is the English translation of a Scottish clan name "MacKay", which translates to "son of a cow". So, there you have it, I am a brain who is the son of a cow.
