I am currently a postdoctoral appointee at the [Argonne Leadership Computing Facility](https://www.alcf.anl.gov) working as a High-Performance Computing expert supporting a [project](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/projects/high-fidelity-simulation-fusion-reactor-boundary-plasmas) that studies the high-fidelity simulation of edge plasma physics in a [Tokamak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokamak) fusion reactor. I originally began my fascination with nuclear energy about fifteen years ago in high school chemistry. My previous position was as a Graduate Student Research Assistant studying computational electromagnetics in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](http://www.ece.unm.edu) at the [University of New Mexico](http:/www.unm.edu). During my graduate studies, I published two journal articles (with more to come based on that research), participated in about a half-dozen inter/national conferences, and numerous other professional gatherings. My research was supervised by [Zhen Peng](https://sites.google.com/site/zhenpeng11111/home), and was focused on the development and implementation of novel algorithms to tackle extreme-scale electromagnetic engineering problems. My doctoral research was primarily supported by the DoD HPCMP PETTT Program.

This website is hosted on [Github](http://www.github.com), the domain is provided by [Google Domains](http://domains.google), and this website is developed in [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). I took this template from [Steven Miller](https://github.com/svmiller/steve-ngvb-jekyll-template) at Clemson University.
