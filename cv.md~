You can download my academic CV [here](http://brimacki.github.io/professionalDocuments/CV.pdf), my professional résumé [here](http://brimacki.github.io/professionalDocuments/Résumé.pdf), my publication list [here](http://brimacki.github.io/professionalDocuments/Publication%20List.pdf), and a full database of all of my relevant activities [here](http://brimacki.github.io/professionalDocuments/CV-full.pdf). The academic CV and professional rèsumè have been tailored for perceived potential employers. The database may be of more general interest and is not necessarily tailored or edited to fit any particular purpose.

Over time I will begin to populate this website with a better organized listing of these activities.
